In Objective-C, a rare but perplexing error can occur when dealing with KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management.  If an observer is not properly removed before the observed object is deallocated, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. This is especially problematic if the observer is a weak reference, as the observed object might be deallocated before the observer is removed, resulting in a dangling pointer.
